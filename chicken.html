<H2>Description :</H2>
<p>The chicken is roasted slowly in the oven, with golden crispy skin and tender meat inside.</p>

<H2>Ingredients :</H2>
<ul>
    <li>Whole chicken</li>
    <li>Olive oil or butter</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
    <li>Garlic cloves</li>
    <li>Fresh herbs (like rosemary, thyme, or parsley)</li>
    <li>Lemon</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Carrots (optional)</li>
    <li>Potatoes (optional)</li>
</ul>

<H2>Instructions :</H2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
    <li>Prepare the chicken by removing any giblets from the cavity and patting it dry with paper towels.</li>
    <li>Rub the chicken all over with olive oil or melted butter. Season generously with salt and black pepper, both inside and out.</li>
    <li>Stuff the cavity with crushed garlic cloves, fresh herbs, and lemon halves.</li>
    <li>If desired, place chopped onions, carrots, and potatoes around the chicken in the roasting pan.</li>
    <li>Truss the chicken by tying the legs together with kitchen twine and tucking the wing tips under the body.</li>
    <li>Place the chicken breast-side up on a rack in a roasting pan.</li>
    <li>Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) when measured at the thickest part of the thigh.</li>
    <li>Baste the chicken occasionally with the pan juices to keep it moist.</li>
    <li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat.</li>
    <li>Carve and serve the roasted chicken with your favorite sides. Enjoy!</li>

    <li>Ground beef or Italian sausage</li>

    <li>Garlic, minced</li>
    <li>Tomato sauce or marinara sauce</li>

    <li>Fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    <li>Mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
</ul>
<H2>Instructions :</H2>
<ol>    
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until softened.</li>
    <li>Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper to the meat mixture. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and chopped parsley. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Layer with lasagna noodles, followed by a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture, a layer of meat sauce, and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat these layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
    <li>Let the lasagna rest for about 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This helps it set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
    <li>Enjoy your homemade lasagna!</li>

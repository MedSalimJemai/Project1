<H2>Description :</H2>
<p>Steak is a flavorful cut of beef that is typically grilled or pan-seared to
your desired level of doneness.</p>
<H2>Ingredients :</H2>
<ul>
    <li>Steak (ribeye, sirloin, filet mignon, etc.)</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
    <li>Olive oil or butter</li>
    <li>Garlic cloves (optional)</li>
    <li>Fresh herbs (like rosemary or thyme) (optional)</li>
</ul>
<H2>Instructions :</H2>
<ol>
    <li>Take the steak out of the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking. This helps ensure even cooking.</li>
    <li>Preheat your grill or skillet to high heat.</li>
    <li>Pat the steak dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. This helps achieve a good sear.</li>
    <li>Season both sides of the steak generously with salt and black pepper. You can also add other seasonings if desired.</li>
    <li>If using a skillet, add a small amount of olive oil or butter to the pan and let it heat up until shimmering.</li>
    <li>Place the steak on the hot grill or skillet. For a medium-rare steak, cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness of the steak. Adjust the cooking time for your preferred level of doneness.</li>
    <li>If desired, during the last minute of cooking, you can add crushed garlic cloves and fresh herbs to the pan for extra flavor. Baste the steak with the melted butter or oil.</li>
    <li>Once cooked to your liking, remove the steak from the heat and let it rest for about 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat.</li>
    <li>Slice the steak against the grain and serve. Enjoy your perfectly cooked steak!</li>
</ol>
